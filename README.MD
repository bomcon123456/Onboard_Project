# Onboard Project
# Description:
You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

There are gonna be two sub projects in this project: the frontend and the backend. The frontend will be a single page application built with ReactJS whilst the backend will be some Restful APIs written using Python, Flask, etc.
